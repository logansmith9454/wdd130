        This is my third semester. I am majoring in Computer Science because I enjoy programming and there are many job opportunities in that field. I am from Grace, Idaho, but I lived most of my life in Utah Valley. I have 5 siblings.

        I enjoy solving Rubik's cubes. I'm holding a 19x19 in the picture (Yes, I have solved one). I currently hold 4 Idaho state records in speed solving events.
