    <h4>Roux Method</h4>
    <p>
      The Roux method is a 3x3 speedsolving method that has become increasingly popular in recent years. It is very
      efficient, uses less algorithms than other methods, and utilizes turns in the middle layer in a way that is very
      visually distinct.
    </p>

    <h4>LSE</h4>
    <p>
      LSE stands for Last Six Edges, which is the last part of a Roux solve. There are several steps that it is
      traditionally broken down into, which are EO, LR, and L4E. As a speedcuber learns more advanced techniques, they
      can begin implementing more complicated techniques that help make transitions between steps smoother and take
      fewer moves to execute or even solve multiple of these steps at the same time.
    </p>

    <h4>EO</h4>
    <p>
      EO, or edge orientation, does not solve any pieces, but instead it simplifies the case to something that is much
      easier to see and control. Each edge has one “sticker” that matches either the top or bottom side (in this case,
      either white or yellow). In EO, all the edges are flipped such that the matching sticker is on either the top or
      the bottom face. When this step is complete, the top side will all be white and yellow, and the bottom side will
      all be white and yellow. No white or yellow stickers will be on any other face. There are 9 different cases,
      depending on how many edges are flipped on the top and on the bottom. These can be learned easily and quickly and
      take very few moves. There are also several ways to solve each case, so it is easy to do them from multiple angles
      and cancel moves to make the next step easier.
    </p>

    <h4>LR</h4>
    <p>
      After EO is complete, the left and right faces are finished. Both the left and the right faces are typically
      missing one piece at this point in the solve. The missing pieces are called the LR edges (because they belong to
      the Left and Right faces, while all the other unsolved edges belong in the middle). A beginner would insert the
      two LR edges into the bottom of the cube and put them into the top together to solve everything except the middle
      layer of the cube. In more advanced steps, this process is simplified or completely merged with EO.
    </p>

    <h4>L4E</h4>
    <p>
      L4E stands for Last 4 Edges. At this point in the solve the remaining 4 edges can easily be solved with a few
      simple patterns, resulting in a solved cube. We won’t get into the details here, as this page focuses on the EO
      and LR steps, specifically combining the two.
    </p>

    <h4>EOLR</h4>
    <p>
      EOLR is the process of performing EO while simultaneously inserting the LR edges into the bottom layer of the cube
      so that they can be inserted easily and without pausing. It is done by executing a specific EO case that will make
      it possible to end with the LR edges on the bottom. Sometimes these cases take more moves than the regular EO, but
      it saves moves by eliminating half of the LR step. This is a moderately complicated step and should only be
      learned after one is competent at EO.
    </p>

    <h4>EOLRb</h4>
    <p>
      EOLRb is similar to EOLR, but instead of inserting the LR edges into the bottom of the cube, a specific EOLR case
      is used to solve the LR edges directly. Again, this step is less efficient than EOLR, and much less efficient than
      EO, but it skips the LR step entirely, so it requires less moves overall and can be executed faster. This is a
      very advanced step to use, and very few people in the world know every case and use them effectively. It is very
      complicated to use and should only be learned after one is competent with EOLR.

      Wireframes

    <p>
      Create three wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them here</p>

    <h3>Home</h3>
    <p>
      The home page will explain what EOLRb is and how the other pages work.
    </p>

    <h3>Case subset 1</h3>
    <p>
      The other pages will all have the same layout. I will probably end up with more than 3 pages in the end. Each page
      will show a certain type of case and all of their solutions. An image can be selected from a grid on the left, and
      it will display on the right with it's name, image, and solution(s).
    </p>
    <img src="images/wireframes/eolrb-wireframe-2.png" alt="page 2 wireframe">

    <h3>Case subset 2</h3>
    <p>
      Subsequent pages will work the same as page 2, but with a different type of cases. This makes it much easier to
      find a specific case quickly.
