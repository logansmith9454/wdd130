            <h2>Roux Method</h2>
            <p>
              The Roux method is a 3x3 speedsolving method that has become
              increasingly popular in recent years. It is very efficient, uses
              less algorithms than other methods, and utilizes turns in the
              middle layer in a way that is very visually distinct.

            <h2>LSE</h2>
            <p>
              LSE stands for Last Six Edges, which is the last part of a Roux
              solve. There are several steps that it is traditionally broken
              down into, which are EO, LR, and L4E. As a speedcuber learns more
              advanced LSE, they can begin implementing more complicated
              techniques that help make transitions between steps smoother and
              take fewer moves to execute, or even solve multiple of these steps
              at the same time.

            <h2>EO</h2>
            <p>
              EO, or edge orientation, does not solve any pieces, but instead it
              simplifies the case to something that is much easier to see and
              control. Each edge has one “sticker” that matches either the top
              or bottom side (in this case, either white or yellow). In EO, all
              the edges are flipped such that the matching sticker is on either
              the top or the bottom face. When this step is complete, the top
              side will all be white and yellow, and the bottom side will all be
              white and yellow. No white or yellow stickers will be on any other
              face. There are 9 different cases, depending on how many edges are
              flipped on the top and on the bottom. These can be learned easily
              and quickly and take very few moves. There are also several ways
              to solve each case, so it is easy to do them from multiple angles
              and cancel moves to make the next step easier.

            <h2>LR</h2>
            <p>
              After EO is complete, the left and right faces are finished. Both
              the left and the right faces are typically missing one piece at
              this point in the solve. The missing pieces are called the LR
              edges (because they belong to the Left and Right faces, while all
              the other unsolved edges belong in the middle). A beginner would
              insert the two LR edges into the bottom of the cube and put them
              into the top together to solve everything except the middle layer
              of the cube. In more advanced steps, this process is simplified or
              completely merged with EO.

            <h2>L4E</h2>
            <p>
              L4E stands for Last 4 Edges. At this point in the solve the
              remaining 4 edges can easily be solved with a few simple patterns,
              resulting in a solved cube. We won’t get into the details here, as
              this page focuses on the EO and LR steps, specifically combining
              the two.

            <h2>EOLR</h2>
            <p>
              EOLR is the process of performing EO while simultaneously
              inserting the LR edges into the bottom layer of the cube so that
              they can be inserted easily and without pausing. It is done by
              executing a specific EO case that will make it possible to end
              with the LR edges on the bottom. Sometimes these cases take more
              moves than the regular EO, but it saves moves by eliminating half
              of the LR step. This is a moderately complicated step and should
              only be learned after one is competent at EO.

            <h2>EOLRb</h2>
            <p>
              EOLRb is similar to EOLR, but instead of inserting the LR edges
              into the bottom of the cube, a specific EOLR case is used to solve
              the LR edges directly. Again, this step is less efficient than
              EOLR, and much less efficient than EO, but it skips the LR step
              entirely, so it requires less moves overall and can be executed
              faster. This is a very advanced step to use, and very few people
              in the world know every case and use them effectively. It is very
              complicated to use and should only be learned after one is
              competent with EOLR.
